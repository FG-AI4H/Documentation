# Overview
The project is organized in 5 different streams:
1. The Core Package (CP)
1. The Data Acquisition Package (DAP)
1. The Data Storage Package (DP)
1. The Data Annotation Package (AP)
1. The Evaluation Package (merged with Prediction Package) (EP)
1. The Reporting Package (RP)

Each package has at least one driver in charge of reporting activities to the project management team. Drivers organize the work in their streams and coordinate with contributor members.
