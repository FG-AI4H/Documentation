# Setup your development environment

Thank you for joining our team! Before you can start working with us you will have to setup a few accounts and tools. In our FG-AI4H, we value security and privacy and have established an onboarding process that respects those principles.

## Account creation & access request

Letâ€™s start creating the different accounts you will need.

### GitHub account

Our organisation uses GitHub as its code repository. You are invited to create your GitHub account if not already done. Visit [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) to sign-up. Please make sure to have:

*   a GitHub account (ideally with a complete profile)
    
*   2-factor authentication enabled on their GitHub account
    

#### Access Request

If the pre-requisites are complete, you should make a request by creating an issue in the [DevSecOps Request Repo](https://github.com/FG-AI4H/DevSecOps-Request).

The request should include:

1.  Project name
    
2.  GitHub organization
    
3.  New user's full name
    
4.  New user's GitHub ID
    
5.  New user's email address associated with the GitHub account
    
6.  New user's organization (gov ministry plus division,branch,etc.) or company
    
7.  New user's role on the project (e.g. Developer, QA, DevOps specialist, Scrum Master)
    
8.  GitHub repositories if exist
    
9.  Expiry (optional) - it is the team's responsibility to remove users from the repo when they no longer require it.
    

A sample "good" request is provided below and should be used as a reference for submitting requests:

```java
GitHub User Access Request:
- Project: FG-AI4H
- GitHub Org: myOrg
- Full name: John Doe
- GitHub ID: johnedoe
- Email address: john.dow@itu.int
- Organization: OCIO, Service BC
- Project role: Full-stack Developer
- Existing GitHub Repo: https://github.com/fg-ai4h/annotation, https://github.com/fg-ai4/ai-audit
```

Once received, the Admin/Owner of the repository can invite you as `Member`.

### AWS account

The FG-AI4H leverages AWS Cloud services to host its softwares. In some cases, depending on your work, you might need access to AWS console. If this is the case please make a request by creating an issue in the [DevSecOps Request Repo](https://github.com/FG-AI4H/DevSecOps-Request) and choosing Request AWS Account.
