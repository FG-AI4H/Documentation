# Reporting Package: Overview
1. Reporting Package (RP) primarily deals with the preparation and presentation of AI4H model evaluation results generated by the Evaluation Package (EP) of the AI4H assessment platform.
2. Reporting Package provides a unified structure to communicate and report the performance scores, metrics and their measures, properties, features and limitations of the AI4H model evaluation process as well as information related to the allied computational platform performance measures
3. Reporting Package provides a customizable reporting interface to support ease of comparison,  classification and reproducibility of different AI4H model evaluation results
# Reporting Modalities
1.Basic Report (STATIC MODE): A non-configurable reporting mode is provided for the user to generate a basic reporting format for AI4H model evaluation results
2. Custom Report  (INTERACTIVE MODE): A configurable reporting mode is provided for the user to configure the reporting parameters and to generate a customized reporting format for the AI4H model evaluation results
# Reporting Parameter Criteria
