# Overview
We decided to use AWS as our Cloud provider for the Free Software project. The motivation comes from the fact that for the Evaluation Package we rely on an Open Source software called [EvalAI](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI) which works on AWS. Later (after MVP), the Cloud provider will be reassessed.
